# NetScaler-Tuning

A collection of information I have pulled together over the years on performance tuning of the Citrix NetScaler. These changes improve the performance of the flows through the NetScaler and reduce resource utilization.
Some of these are pretty simple, like enabling SACK and Window Scaling. Others are more complex such as the OOO buffer tuning. For each parameter I have included what it means and the min, max and default values.

The work here builds on my 2012 Synergy presentation on performance tuning, which focused on version 8. You will find the pdf in this repo and on slideshare https://github.com/masonke/NetScaler-Tuning.
